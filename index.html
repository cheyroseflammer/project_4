      <p>Our aim for this data analyst project was to predict whether or not a game was a hit or
        not.</p>

              The necessary data was already collected and structured into CSV files on Kaggle. We
              explored our data using pandas to read our csv into a dataframe and viewed the first 5
              results using head() to give us an idea of what our data looked like. Investigating
              the data further we created bar charts to visualize features of interest; comparing
              game count by platform, developer, publisher, and genre in separate charts. We also
              explored critic-score by global sales to see what kind of correlation there may be.

            <p>
              Our data was nicely organized for visualizations but far from perfect for us to plug
              into our Machine Learning model. Beginning our wrangling process we needed to drop any
              duplicated rows and null values. Perfect, now that our data was somewhat optimized we
              wanted to figure out which feature would be useful in defining a game as “hit”. We
              decided that any game that had a global sales over 10 would return 1 and anything
              under would return 0 saving those values to a new column called “Hit”.

              The first model we tested was the Random Forest which gave us an accuracy score of .84
              and our second model we tested was the Logistic Regression which gave us a slightly
              higher accuracy score of .86 which is the percentage of correct predictions. Our
              precision which is the percentage of positive predictions correct was 0.71. Our
              sensitivity which is our true positive rate 0.71 as well. Finally, our F1 score, which
              is the balance between precision and sensitivity, was .92.

              Since our predicting value was a binary outcome either being 1 a “hit” or 0 a “no hit”
              we decided to go with Random Forest and Logistic Regression.The features we would be
              using from our original data frame would be “Name”, “Platform”, “Genre”, “Publisher”,
              “Year_of_Release”, “Critic_Score” and an additional column we created “Hit”. We then
              used get_dummies to convert our categorical data into indicator variables and after we
              split our data into “X” and “y” dataframes to separate our data from our labels.
              Finally, we used train_test_split to create a .75/.25 split into training and test
              data.
