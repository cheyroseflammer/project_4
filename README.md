This project consisted of building a machine learning model to predict whether or not a video game would be considered a "hit."

The idea of a "hit" is defined by a game's global sales and several other factors such as critic and user score.

The dataset chosen to tackle this project inluded the following features: 

Name, Platform, Year of Release, Genre, Publisher, NA Sales, EU Sales, JP Sales, Other Sales, Global Sales, Critic Score, Critic Count, User Score, User Count, Developer, and Rating
